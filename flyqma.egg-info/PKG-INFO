Description: Fly-QMA
        =======
        
        **Fly-QMA** is part of the **NU FlyEye** platform for studying gene expression in the developing *Drosophila* eye. The package enables Quantitative Mosaic Analysis (QMA) - that is, it helps users compare expression levels between distinct clonal subpopulations within the eye epithelium.
        
        Expression patterns are typically identified by comparing the fluorescence of target gene reporters between groups of cells. Fly-QMA helps quantify these differences in reporter expression. Quantification entails measuring fluorescence intensities by analyzing experimentally collected images of fixed eye discs. Such measurements may then used to identify and compare distinct subpopulations within the eye field.
        
        Given confocal microscopy data, the Fly-QMA package facilitates:
        
          - **Segmentation.** Detect cell nuclei within a microscope image
        
          - **Measurement.** Quantify reporter expression levels
        
          - **Bleedthrough Control.** Correct for fluorescence bleedthrough
        
          - **Annotation.** Identify distinct subpopulations of cells
        
          - **Cell Selection.** Manually select cells for comparison
        
          - **Comparison.** Compare expression levels between subpopulations
