Fly-QMA
=======

**Fly-QMA** is part of the **NU FlyEye** platform for studying gene expression in the developing *Drosophila* eye. The Fly-QMA package enables quantitative mosaic analysis (QMA) - that is, it helps compare expression levels between distinct clonal subpopulations within the eye epithelium.

Given confocal microscopy data, the package facilitates:

  - **Segmentation.** Detect cell nuclei within a microscope image

  - **Measurement.** Quantify reporter expression levels

  - **Bleedthrough Control.** Correct for fluorescence bleedthrough

  - **Annotation.** Identify distinct subpopulations of cells

  - **Cell Selection.** Manually select cells for comparison

  - **Comparison.** Compare expression levels between subpopulations

To see Fly-QMA in action, check out `our study <https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/pnt_yan_ratio>`_ of Pnt and Yan expression during retinal patterning in *Drosophila*.
